# sfguide-getting-started-with-snowpark-for-machine-learning-on-vertexai

## Overview

In this guide, we will perform data preperation and machine learning tasks to train a model to predict machine failure using VertexAI, Snowpark for Python and scikit-learn. By the end of the session, you will have built a model in VertexAI and deployed it to Snowflake.
